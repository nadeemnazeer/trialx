Patients meeting the Durie and Salmon criteria for initial diagnosis of multiple

<str>myeloma.</str>
<str>
All patients with multiple myeloma requiring therapy.
</str>
<str>Patients less than or equal to 70 years of age.</str>
<str>
Patients will be eligible after initial therapy in either first complete or partial
</str>
<str>remission or if no objective response is achieved.</str>
<str>
Patients achieving initial response and later disease progression will be eligible
</str>
<str>
after subsequent therapy upon achievement of either complete or partial response.
</str>
<str>
Patients will be ineligible if they have advanced myeloma refractory to salvage
</str>
<str>chemotherapy regimens.</str>

left ventricular ejection fraction > 45% by MUGA scan); renal function (creatinine
</str>

clearance > 40 ml/min); liver function (bilirubin < 2.0 mg/dl ALT < 3x the upper
